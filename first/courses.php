			<strong>Spring 2013:</strong> My fist is punching harder than bullet during the last two weeks.
			Class lecture lasts about 3-5 hrs a day. I spent on average about 3-6 hrs a day just studying 
			and practicing what I've learnt from classes the same day. Furthermore, depends on the number of quizes and
			tests I'll get in that week, I will throw in more study time. Let's me break down my typical day,
			get up and 7:00am in order to get ready for 9:00am - 1:00pm classes, study from 3-8pm, other misc: 
			2hrs for commuting,2hrs of cooking and eating, and yes, about 5-6 hr of sleep if im lucky. Yes, this pattern
			repeat from mon-fri. The perfect storm, was during week 7 where I have
			two midterms and two quizes back to back in just two days. I was literally sleep, eat, and breath on
			a schedule. Did i mention that I worked on 6 hrs on Satursday as well which make sunday to be the 
			play / get-ready for work day. <strong> I will say this with confident, this is by
			far the most challenging 10 weeks experience of my life. It teaches me to work hard as hell and be very
			determine toward my goal. Perhaps, this is the most important lesson I learn this quarter, "I learnt to push
			surpass my physical and mental limitation".   </strong>
