				Hey everyone, welcome to ShareThem.info. I'm currently a full-time student at University of
				Washington and a part-time math tutor. Okay, lets cut to the chase, the reason why
				I'm building this website from scratch (without using any site-builder tools) because I want to 
				put good use of what I've learned in college and build a library of information for myself 
				and "share them" with everyone who have the similar hobby as mine. Plus, I got really 
				inspired during one of Steve Wozniak aka The Woz interviews, he was asked by the interviewer to 
				give an opinion regarding SOPA, steve went on to describe his philosophy of the freedom of information, 
				he said, <em>"if you love something so much then you have 
				to share it (your passion) with other people" </em>.

				For the past year, I was fortunate enough work as a tutor helping students with various subjects at 
				college campus. I've been tutoring many subjects in the past two years,
				ranging from Algebra, Pre-Calculus, Some Calculus, Statistic, Chemistry...etc I hope this list keep on
				expanding as the time rolls on.
